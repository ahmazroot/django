Prompt for AI to Explain Multi-Tenant SaaS Customer Service Application Architecture with External API Integration
Please provide a detailed explanation of the architecture for a multi-tenant SaaS customer service application built with Django, using a shared database and shared schema approach. The application allows users to create accounts, add their data, and interact with a chat API endpoint (/api/chat/call) that integrates with an external AI API (e.g., https://text.uuuuai.ai/{prompt}). The external API accepts a prompt from the user, a system parameter set by the tenant, and other parameters like model and seed. Each tenant has a unique domain (e.g., tenant1.myapp.com) used for identification via the HTTP Host header, with no user-level authentication. Responses from the external API must be processed and stored in a way that ensures they are associated only with the respective tenant’s data. Focus on the architectural design and specifications without including any code, code snippets, or coding suggestions. Describe the following:

Overview of the Application:

Explain the purpose of the SaaS application for customer service, enabling tenants (e.g., companies) to manage customer interactions via a chat interface.
Highlight the multi-tenant architecture using a shared database and shared schema, where all tenants share the same database tables.
Describe the key functionality: user account creation, data addition, a chat API endpoint that calls an external AI API, and token limit tracking per tenant for API usage.


Tenant Identification via HTTP Host Header:

Explain how the HTTP Host header (e.g., tenant1.myapp.com) is used to identify the tenant for each request to /api/chat/call.
Describe the process of mapping the domain from the Host header to a tenant identifier in the system, ensuring requests are processed for the correct tenant without requiring user authentication.
Discuss how this approach simplifies client interactions, as clients only need to access the correct domain to associate requests with their tenant.


External API Integration:

Describe how the /api/chat/call endpoint integrates with an external AI API (e.g., https://text.uuuuai.ai/{prompt}).
Explain how the user-provided prompt (e.g., "Explain the theory of relativity simply") is sent to the external API, along with tenant-specific parameters like system (e.g., "Explain things like I'm five") that are set by the tenant.
Detail how additional parameters (e.g., model, seed) are included in the API call, with the system parameter being unique to each tenant’s configuration.
Discuss how the response from the external API is processed and associated with the tenant’s data.


Database Architecture:

Describe the shared database, shared schema structure, where all tenant data is stored in the same tables with a tenant_id field for isolation.
Specify the key tables involved:
Tenant table: Stores tenant information, including name, domain, token limit, token usage, and tenant-specific system parameter for the external API.
ChatMessage table: Stores chat interactions, including user prompts, API responses, and token usage, linked to a tenant.
CustomerData table: Stores additional tenant-specific data added by users.


Explain how data isolation is maintained by associating all records with a tenant_id.


Request Processing for /api/chat/call:

Outline the flow of a request to the /api/chat/call endpoint:
Identify the tenant using the Host header (e.g., tenant1.myapp.com).
Retrieve the tenant’s configuration, including the system parameter and token limits.
Validate the tenant’s token limit against current usage.
Send the user’s prompt and tenant’s system parameter to the external AI API.
Store the API response in the ChatMessage table, linked to the tenant’s tenant_id.
Update the tenant’s token usage based on the API call.


Describe how responses are filtered to include only the tenant’s data, ensuring no cross-tenant data leakage.


Security Considerations:

Discuss how data isolation is enforced to prevent one tenant from accessing another’s data, using the tenant_id filter for all database operations.
Explain the role of domain validation (via the Host header) in ensuring requests are processed only for valid tenants.
Highlight protections against abuse, such as rate limiting per tenant and enforcement of token limits to prevent excessive API usage.
Address the security of tenant-specific system parameters to ensure they are not exposed or misused.


Scalability and Performance:

Describe how the architecture supports scalability for multiple tenants (e.g., 1-1000 tenants) using a shared schema.
Explain strategies for optimizing performance, such as caching tenant-to-domain mappings and tenant configurations (e.g., system parameters) to reduce database queries.
Discuss handling concurrent requests from multiple users within the same tenant, ensuring consistent token tracking and data integrity.


Infrastructure Requirements:

Outline the role of DNS configuration to support wildcard subdomains (e.g., *.myapp.com) for tenant identification.
Describe the server setup, including a reverse proxy to route requests based on the Host header and an application server to process requests.
Mention considerations for load balancing and high availability to handle multiple tenants and concurrent API calls.


Advantages and Trade-offs:

Highlight the benefits of using the Host header for tenant identification, such as simplicity, minimal client configuration, and seamless integration with the external API.
Discuss limitations, such as reliance on proper DNS setup and lack of user-level authentication, and how the architecture mitigates these (e.g., through domain validation and tenant-specific data filtering).
Explain how the tenant-specific system parameter enhances customization while maintaining isolation.



Ensure the explanation is clear, concise, and focused on the architectural design at a conceptual level. Avoid any technical implementation details, such as code, libraries, specific Django configurations, or coding suggestions. Provide a high-level overview suitable for understanding the system’s structure, functionality, and integration with the external AI API, emphasizing tenant isolation and tenant-specific customization of API calls.
